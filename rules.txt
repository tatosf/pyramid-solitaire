Pyramid solitaire game rules:

The main goal is to remove all cards from the pyramid
structure of cards shown in the game.

The pyramid is made of 28 unique playing cards. These cards are split up into 7 rows in which row 1 has 1 card, row 2
has 2 cards, and so on. To remove cards from the structure, you must pick 2 accessible cards which add up to equal 13.

- Aces = 1
- Jack = 11
- Queen = 12
- King = 13  *To remove a king, it must be picked first

Although on this game, all the cards in the pyramid are fully visible, the cards that you can access and pick
to be compared must be ones that aren't covered by any other cards. Therefore, to start, only 7th row cards can be
used. To access the rows beneath, you must first remove the cards above. 

The rest of the cards are situated in the stock pile at the start of the game. The stock is a pile of face up cards
that can be used to help remove cards from the pyramid. When the stock is empty, the waste reverses it's order.

In all outcomes, you will be given a score based on how many cards you removed from the pyramid, where in the pyramid the cards were removed from, and any extra cards that you may have removed from the
stock/waste.

Good luck!
